# Pantone® data

All Pantone® datas have been manually scrapped from [Pantone Color Finder](https://www.pantone.com/color-finder) by spying on the Network tab in Chrome devtools and listening to XHR queries.

Each JSON file represents a Pantone® book.

Some books have been updated with CMYK values, scrapped from [Pantone website](https://pantone.com) using `scripts/scrap-pantone-cmyk`.
